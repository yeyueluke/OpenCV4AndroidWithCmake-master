# OpenCV4AndroidWithCmake
Use Android Studio 3.0 and Cmake Toolchain to make your Android device fly with Opencv (OpenCV 3.40)
You don't have to add more third-party libs to use OpenCV, this project provides both java and ndk support (with Cmake).

**This Project only includes armeabi-v7a**

## CHANGELOG

* 2017-01-13
update to OpenCV 3.20
* 2017-12-28
update to OpenCV 3.40 (opencv_java.so can be replaced by static libs to reduce the size of APK)
Old versions can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Martin20150405/OpenCV4AndroidWithCmake/releases)

## Works
* Use Cmake to compile OpenCV 3.4 for Androidï¼Œdon't need Android.mk (applicable for OpenCV 2.4X theoretically)
* Support both Java and NDK OpenCV (With code complecation)
* remove OpenCV Manager

## [Tutorial](http://blog.csdn.net/martin20150405/article/details/53284442)
